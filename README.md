#EcoTrack: Environmental Monitoring and Analytics System
Project Overview

EcoTrack is an environmental monitoring system that collects real-time data from IoT sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality levels. This data is processed and visualized in a user-friendly web dashboard, and the system includes machine learning algorithms for predicting future environmental conditions. Users can view historical data, set alerts for unusual conditions, and receive notifications when thresholds are exceeded. EcoTrack also features a mobile app for easy access to live environmental data on the go.
